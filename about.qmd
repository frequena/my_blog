I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Weill Cornell (New York). My current work focuses on the development of machine learning tools for drug discovery in Alzheimer's disease. I did my PhD at the Clinical Bioinformatics lab in the Imagine Institute (Paris) where I worked on the development of computational methods, including machine-learning, for the clinical interpretation of variants in rare disease patients.
