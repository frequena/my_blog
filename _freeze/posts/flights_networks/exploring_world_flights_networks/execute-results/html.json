In the Chapter 4 of his book, it depicts the USA airport networks to **represent scale-free networks**. I was wondering if we can get a *world picture*, creating the same network but including the global routes using open data from internet.\n\n## 1. What is a scale-free network?\n\nScale-free networks are characterized by a large number of nodes with low degree (number of links) and very few hubs with a high degree. If we represent the distribution of degrees of these nodes, it follows a power-law distribution. To illustrate this idea, let's create a quick example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidygraph) \nlibrary(ggraph)\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n# 1. Example showing a scale-free network\nscale_free_net <- play_barabasi_albert(n = 1000, power = 1)\n# 1.1 Scale-free network\np1 <- ggraph(scale_free_net, layout = 'kk') + \n  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.3) + \n  geom_node_point(fill = 'steelblue', color = 'black', shape = 21) +\n  ggtitle('Scale-free network') + \n  theme_graph()\nvector_values <- degree_distribution(scale_free_net)[-1] # Eliminate first element, it represents zero degree vertices\n  \ndf <- data.frame(frequency = vector_values,\n                 degrees = seq(1, length(vector_values),1))\n# 1.2 Degree distribution\np2 <- ggplot(df, aes(degrees, frequency)) +\n  geom_col(fill = 'steelblue', color = 'black') +\n  ggtitle('Degree Distribution of a scale-free network') +\n  ylab('Relative frequency') +\n  xlab('Number of links') +\n  theme_bw()\np1 + p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exploring_world_flights_networks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMany real networks share this feature. For instance, if we take a look how internet is organized and calculate the number of links that every site has, we find that the most of websites (nodes) have a low number of links (edges) and very few will have a large number of links (e.g. Google, Facebook...). Other examples are social, co-authorship or protein-protein network.\n\nWe hope to see the same pattern through our airport's network: *very few airports have a large number of routes while the most will have few routes*.\n\n## 2. Data (airports and routes)\n\nAt the beginning, we talked about creating our own network of airlines routes. To achieve this, we download our data from [Openflights](https://openflights.org) whose have a lot of information about flights. We will just download data about **airports** (selecting: code, longitude and latitude) and **routes** (selecting: name, code source, code destination and continent location). Besides, we will clean those observations with NA's values or wrong strings.\n\n**Important**: Aiports will be the nodes of our network and the routes will conform the edges between the nodes.\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data with routes\n# https://openflights.org/data.html#route\ndf <- read.csv('data/routes.dat',header = FALSE,\n               stringsAsFactors = FALSE,\n               col.names = c('airline', 'airline_id', 'src', 'src_id', 'dest', 'dest_id', 'codeshare','stops',  'equip'))[,c(3,5)]\n# Data with airport information\n# https://openflights.org/data.html#airport\ndf2 <- read.csv('data/airports.dat',header = FALSE,\n                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[,c(2,5,7,8,12)]\ncolnames(df2) <- c('name','code', 'lat', 'long', 'location')\n# Clean data\ndf_airport <- df2 %>% \n  filter(!str_detect(code, fixed(\"\\\\N\"))) %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(location, fixed(\"\\\\N\"))) %>%\n  as_tibble()\ntmp_loc <- str_split(df_airport$location, '/')\ndf_airport$location <- map_chr(tmp_loc, function(x) x[[1]])\ndf_airport <- df_airport %>% mutate(location = as.factor(location))\ndf_routes <- df %>% \n  filter(!str_detect(src, fixed(\"\\\\N\")) & !str_detect(dest, fixed(\"\\\\N\"))) %>%\n  filter(!src == dest) %>%\n  group_by(src, dest) %>%\n  count() %>%\n  arrange(desc(n)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  as_tibble()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3. Airport Network visualization\n\nTo make possible the downstream analysis, we have to transform the observations of our dataframe into nodes and edges (tbl_graph object). We can do this thanks to the **package ggraph**. Once we do this, we will be able to visualise the network applying different algorithms layers and calculate topological parameters of the nodes that otherwise would not be possible.\n\nFor instance, we can choose the 'mds' layout (you can find many other layouts described [here](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-layouts/)). This algorithm layout measures the shortest path between each node and display together those nodes which are closer in the network. Besides, we are going to calculate some scores per node and to make faster the algorithm, I will eliminate those airports whose number of routes are low.\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert dataframe (df_routes) to tbl_graph object (df_graph)\ndf_graph <- as_tbl_graph(df_routes,directed = FALSE) %>% activate(edges) %>%\n  filter(!edge_is_multiple()) %>% activate(nodes) %>%\n  mutate(n_degree = centrality_degree(),\n         betweenness = centrality_betweenness(),\n         community = group_walktrap(),\n         n_triangles = local_triangles(),\n         clust = local_transitivity()) %>%\n  left_join(df_airport, by = c('name' = 'code')) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(lat) & !is.na(long))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nFALSE Warning in betweenness(graph = graph, v = V(graph), directed = directed, :\nFALSE 'nobigint' is deprecated since igraph 1.3 and will be removed in igraph 1.4\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ggraph(df_graph %>% activate(nodes) %>% filter(n_degree >= 10), layout = \"mds\") + \n#   geom_edge_link(aes(edge_width = n), alpha = 0.1, edge_colour = 'gray') + \n#   geom_node_point(aes(size = n_degree, fill = location), shape = 21) +\n#   scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1') +\n#   scale_size(range = c(0, 14)) +\n#   theme_graph() +\n#   guides(size=FALSE, edge_width = FALSE, fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 7))) +\n#   ggtitle('Airports network')\n```\n:::\n\n\nBesides, we plot the degree distribution of our network using ggplot2. For that, we convert our tbl_graph to a dataframe (the reverse step we did before) applying the function *activation(nodes)* and then *as_tibble()*.\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Degree distribution\ndf_nodes <- df_graph %>% activate(nodes) %>% as_tibble()\nggplot(df_nodes, aes(n_degree)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = 'steelblue', color = 'black', binwidth = 1) +\n  ggtitle('Degree Distribution of airports network') +\n  ylab('Frequency') +\n  xlab('Number of links') +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exploring_world_flights_networks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we saw at the beginning, both networks follow a power-law distribution.\n\n## 4.

This number is called diameter and can be calculated easily:\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_graph %>% activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(diam = graph_diameter()) %>% \n  distinct(diam) %>% \n  as_tibble()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   diam\n  <dbl>\n1    12\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe longest path is 12 steps. Not so long if we take into account the remote distance of some of the airports (Siberia, Greenland, Pacific regions...).\n\n## What is the shortest path between two airports?\n\nWe can select an airport and calculate the shortest path needed to reach another one. For instance, the Charles de Gaulle Airport (Paris) is one step from Adolfo Suárez Madrid--Barajas (Madrid), but what is the number of steps needed to reach the Hawai's airport from Paris? Let's calculate it:\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshortest_paths(df_graph, 'CDG', 'HNL')$vpath[[1]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n+ 3/3209 vertices, named, from 74156b1:\n[1] CDG ORD HNL\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe **shortest path** from Paris to Honolulu is: Paris -\\> Chicago -\\> Honolulu.\n\nNow, imagine that we calculate all the shortest paths between Paris and the rest of airports and we repeat it with every airport and calculate the average. This value is called: **average shortest path** and is average number of minimum connections required from any airport to any other airport.\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_graph %>% activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(dist = graph_mean_dist()) %>% \n  distinct(dist) %>% \n  as_tibble()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   dist\n  <dbl>\n1  3.97\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average shortesth path is 3.94, almost 4 steps on average to go from an airport to any other.\n\n## What is the longest distance possible from a specific airport?\n\nWe are in Paris again, and we want to go to the most distant airport possible (in steps). This value is called **eccentricity** and is specific for each airport. Let's take a look at three of the most connected airports:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_graph_eccen <- df_graph %>% activate(nodes) %>% \n  mutate(eccentricity = node_eccentricity()) %>% as_tibble()\n  \ndf_graph_eccen %>% \n  filter(name == 'ATL' | name == 'CDG' | name == 'AMS') %>% \n  select(name.y, eccentricity )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  name.y                                           eccentricity\n  <chr>                                                   <dbl>\n1 Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport            7\n2 Charles de Gaulle International Airport                     7\n3 Amsterdam Airport Schiphol                                  7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe would need 7 steps to go from Paris to the most distant airport, the same value obtained with Atlanta and Amsterdam airports. This make sense as we have selected nodes with the highest nº of routes. But the value 7 is the lowest that we can get?\n\nLet's see the distribution:\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The filter(eccentricity > 2) eliminate those airports that are disconnected from the main network and have a eccentricity from 0 to 2\nggplot(df_graph_eccen %>% filter(eccentricity > 2), aes(eccentricity)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = 'steelblue', color = 'black') +\n  ylab('Nº of airports') +\n  theme(text = element_text(size=20))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exploring_world_flights_networks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we see above, most of the airports are located between 8 and 9. Those airports with the highest number of routes have a value of 7. But there is an airport whose value is 6.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n df_graph_eccen %>% filter(eccentricity == 6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 11\n  name  n_deg…¹ betwe…² commu…³ n_tri…⁴ clust name.y   lat  long locat…⁵ eccen…⁶\n  <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <int>   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>  <dbl> <dbl> <fct>     <dbl>\n1 YYZ       147 249941.       1    2061 0.192 Leste…  43.7 -79.6 America       6\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​n_degree, ²​betweenness, ³​community,\n#   ⁴​n_triangles, ⁵​location, ⁶​eccentricity\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWell, it is interesting that the airport with the lowest eccentricity is **Lester B. Pearson International Airport** located at Toronto. Its number of routes (n_degree) is not very high but has an important particularity. If we see the map, Canada is a country with a large number of airports sparse along the territory. While the majority of airports have to \"spend\" steps to reach those distant airport (mainly at the north of the territory), this airport is very close to them and at the same time is close to the rest of airports across the world (USA, Europe, China...)\n\n## Where are the hubs?\n\nWe can detect also the most relevant hubs (densely connected subgraphs) and display those airports that belongs to one of the top 10 hubs:\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(df_nodes %>% filter(community <= 10), aes(long, lat)) + worldmap + \n  geom_point(aes(fill = as.factor(community)), color = 'black', shape = 21) +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Paired') +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 12))) +\n  ggtitle(' Aiports across the world by region') +\n  labs(fill=\"List of Hubs\") +\n  theme_map()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exploring_world_flights_networks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe have applied a walktrap community finding algorithm that uses random walks between the nodes and group those airports that are connected by short random walks.\n\nIf you take a look at the map, these hubs represent not only a group of airports densely connected but also political and economical hubs. For instance, a hub includes Ex-soviets states, another Europe, Canary Islands and some cities from Magreb.\n\nIn addition, we can classify the airports in 3 categories:\n\n-   **Core**: Those aiports whose have the highest number of triangles (subgraph of 3 nodes and 3 edges). If an airport is located in many triangles, we consider it as a well connected airport.\n-   **Peryphery**: Airports that are located in distant regions with few routes.\n-   **Bridge**: Those airports that allow the communication between the airports that form the core and the periphery.\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_nodes <- df_nodes %>% mutate(category = 'Bridge')\ndf_nodes$category <- ifelse(df_nodes$n_triangles > 400, 'Core', df_nodes$category)\ndf_nodes$category <- ifelse(df_nodes$clust == 0, 'Periphery', df_nodes$category)\nggplot(df_nodes, aes(long, lat)) + worldmap +\n  geom_point(aes(fill = category), color = 'black', shape = 21) +\n  facet_grid(category ~.) +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(size=25)) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 20)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](exploring_world_flights_networks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# 5.

At the same time, the **identification of groups of airports**, we have clustered airports by continent, random walks algorithm, or using a blend of centrality measures filtering the nodes in three groups (core, bridge, peripherial).\n\nIn conclusion, network science allows us to improve our knowledge about data that can be converted into a network, through the use of multiple approaches.\n\n# Final notes\n\n-   To simplify this post, I have not included the direction of the edges neither the real distance between airports.\n\n-   A very interesting point is the analysis of the resilence: what would happen if we delete a specific airport from the network? Would the impact be equal across the aiports?\n",
